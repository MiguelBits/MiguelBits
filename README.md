# Hello, I'm Miguel Bits üëã

## üöÄ About Me

I'm a Solidity Developer with a profound dedication to building infrastructure that promotes decentralization and empowers individuals. My journey began in the Web2 space, where I honed my skills in software development, automation, and cybersecurity, working with notable companies like Nokia, Altice Portugal, and Everis/NTT Data. Transitioning to the world of blockchain, I've become a security enthusiast, protocol designer, and advocate for open, decentralized systems.

- üî≠ Currently, I'm focusing on developing smart contracts and protocols that bring real value and security to the DeFi space.
- üå± I'm on a continuous learning path to deepen my knowledge in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize how we interact with the digital and financial worlds.
