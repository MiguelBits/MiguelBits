# Hello, I'm Miguel Bits 👋

##  🔍💻🤓  About Me
[Podcasts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYAW5hNp4y4&ab_channel=CryptoCafe)

I'm a DeFi Ethereum Developer with a profound dedication to building infrastructure that promotes decentralization and empowers individuals. My journey began in the Web2 space, where I honed my skills in software development, automation, and cybersecurity, working with notable companies like Nokia, Altice Portugal, and Everis/NTT Data.    Transitioning to the world of blockchain, I've become a security enthusiast, protocol designer, and advocate for open, decentralized systems.

- 🔭 Currently, I'm focusing on developing smart contracts and protocols that bring real value and security to the DeFi space, and Decentralization.
- 🌱 I'm on a continuous learning path to deepen my knowledge in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize how we interact with the digital and financial worlds.
- 💬 Ask me about Solidity, smart contract security, or anything related to blockchain.
- 📫 Reach me at: mcruzvas@gmail.com or follow me on Twitter [@0xMiguelBits](https://twitter.com/0xMiguelBits).
- 📍 Based in Remote Lisbon, Portugal.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My journey into blockchain was sparked during the GameStop short squeeze in early 2021. Witnessing firsthand how Wall Street could manipulate markets with minimal consequences. I felt the urgent need for change! As a retail investor, the experience left me frustrated with the centralized powers that govern the world. Inspired by the resilience of GameStop investors 💎🤲 , I'm now committed to creating decentralized systems.   
- 🚀 My goal? To build a financial world that is transparent, censorship-resistant, and truly empowers the individual. Here's to decentralization, where every one of us has a fighting chance.

But also managing resources and time for development. Often required to make tough decisions that can impact the direction of their teams and the company. These decisions can involve changing development architecture to minimize the product and get a go-to-market product asap, project prioritization, or strategic shifts, often under conditions of uncertainty.
