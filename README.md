##  üîçüíªü§ì  About Me

I'm a DeFi Ethereum Developer with a profound dedication to building infrastructure that promotes decentralization and empowers individuals. My journey began in the Web2 space, where I honed my skills in software development, automation, and cybersecurity, working with notable companies like Nokia, Altice Portugal, and Everis/NTT Data.    Transitioning to the world of blockchain, I've become a security enthusiast, protocol designer, and advocate for open, decentralized systems.

- üî≠ Currently, I'm focusing on developing smart contracts and protocols that bring real value and security to the DeFi space, and Decentralization.
- üå± I'm on a continuous learning path to deepen my knowledge in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize how we interact with the digital and financial worlds.
- üí¨ Ask me about Solidity, smart contract security, or anything related to blockchain.
- üì´ Reach me at: mcruzvas@gmail.com or follow me on Twitter [@0xMiguelBits](https://twitter.com/0xMiguelBits).
- üìç Based in Remote Lisbon, Portugal.
- ‚ö° Fun fact: My journey into blockchain was sparked during the GameStop short squeeze in early 2021. Witnessing firsthand how Wall Street could manipulate markets with minimal consequences. I felt the urgent need for change! As a retail investor, the experience left me frustrated with the centralized powers that govern the world. Inspired by the resilience of GameStop investors üíéü§≤ , I'm now committed to creating decentralized systems.   
- üöÄ My goal? To build a financial world that is transparent, censorship-resistant, and truly empowers the individual. Here's to decentralization, where every one of us has a fighting chance.
