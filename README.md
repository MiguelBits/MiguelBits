# Hello, I'm Miguel Bits üëã

## üöÄ About Me

I'm a Solidity Developer with a profound dedication to building infrastructure that promotes decentralization and empowers individuals. My journey began in the Web2 space, where I honed my skills in software development, automation, and cybersecurity, working with notable companies like Nokia, Altice Portugal, and Everis/NTT Data. Transitioning to the world of blockchain, I've become a security enthusiast, protocol designer, and advocate for open, decentralized systems.

- üî≠ Currently, I'm focusing on developing smart contracts and protocols that bring real value and security to the DeFi space, and Decentralization.
- üå± I'm on a continuous learning path to deepen my knowledge in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize how we interact with the digital and financial worlds.
- üí¨ Ask me about Solidity, smart contract security, or anything related to blockchain.

- üìç Based in Remote Lisbon, Portugal.
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I've led projects that achieved significant milestones, like a protocol I developed which locked in over $10 million worth of Ethereum in its first week.
