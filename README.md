# Hello, I'm Miguel Bits 👋

##  🔍💻🤓  About Me
Portuguese talk I was invited to talk about AI & Crypto [Podcasts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYAW5hNp4y4&ab_channel=CryptoCafe)  
Developer Documentation guides written by me : [GitBook](https://miguel-de-vasconcelos.gitbook.io/blockchain-technologies)  
  
I'm a DeFi Ethereum Developer with a profound dedication to building infrastructure that promotes decentralization and empowers individuals. My journey began in the Web2 space, where I honed my skills in software development, automation, and cybersecurity, working with notable companies like Nokia, Altice Portugal, and Everis/NTT Data.    Transitioning to the world of blockchain, I've become a security enthusiast, protocol designer, and advocate for open, decentralized systems.

- 🔭 Currently, I'm focusing on developing smart contracts and protocols that bring real value and security to the DeFi space, and Decentralization.
- 🌱 I'm on a continuous learning path to deepen my knowledge in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize how we interact with the digital and financial worlds.
- 💬 Ask me about Solidity, smart contract security, or anything related to blockchain.
- 📫 Reach me at: mcruzvas@gmail.com or follow me on Twitter [@0xMiguelBits](https://twitter.com/0xMiguelBits).
- 📍 Based in Remote Lisbon, Portugal.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My journey into blockchain was sparked during the GameStop short squeeze in early 2021. Witnessing firsthand how Wall Street could manipulate markets with minimal consequences. I felt the urgent need for change! As a retail investor, the experience left me frustrated with the centralized powers that govern the world. Inspired by the resilience of GameStop investors 💎🤲 , I'm now committed to creating decentralized systems.   
- 🚀 My goal? To build a financial world that is transparent, censorship-resistant, and truly empowers the individual. Here's to decentralization, where every one of us has a fighting chance.
